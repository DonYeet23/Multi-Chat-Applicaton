The comments I added were for the errors say "This server is unavallabel"
<h1>So This is what to do</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Open up Windows Terminal</li>
    <li>Type "ipconfig"</li>
    <li>Find your default gateway IP address</li>
    <li>Paste them in the two files</li>
    <li>Then Make up your own port number (NO ONE HAS USED) and put it in the two files</li>
    <li>Then start the server and press connect</li>
    <li>Then start two clients and test</li>
</ul>
